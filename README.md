Firstly, I have made this for the NodeMCU-32S. If you want weather information support, get yourself a API key from Open Weather Map and paste it to OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API = "" in line 15 of main.py. I used Thonny to upload the code. 




NOTE: if you short GND and pin 23 during boot, IT WILL ERASE THE FLASH MEMORY.
